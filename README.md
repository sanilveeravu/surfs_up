# Surf And Shake Shop Analysis

## Overview of the Project

To start a new business venture serving surfboards and ice cream in Hawaii an initial business plan was put up. One key concern was on the weather. This project is to analyze an available weather dataset to determine the risks and if this idea will be successful.

After looking at different weather factors like precipitation, stations and temperature, things looked good. One final research here is to check the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu and perform an analysis on this.
